A manager that can be called to add, delete, and list nodes in the google cloud. The interface to follow is specified in cloudManagerBaseClass; currently cloudManager implements the interface for Google Compute Engine.

Current supported methods:

- addNode
- deleteNode
- listNodes
- getNode (returns an object from google)
These methods are all pretty self-explanatory. The kicker with Google is the specifics of the required config. In the config file, we need:

- projectId: needs to match with an existing Google Developers project. Make sure Google Compute Engine API is turned on!
- zone : the zone where the VM's will be made.
- serviceAccountJSONKey: This should point to the file that stores the service account JSON Key, as generated by Google: head to the Google Developers Console -> APIs & auth -> Credentials -> add Credentials, and select the Service account option. This should generate the key; store it in an offline location.
- startupScriptUrl: the Url of the bash script that should be run at startup.
